* Release 0.2 (2014-03-09)

  * Added support for waiting multiple PIDs.

  * The new ‘--verbose’ option can be specified both to inspect the exit status
    of the traced processes and to trace the signals sent to them.

  * waitpid can now be used even if ptrace(2) is not available (throught
    ‘--verbose’ won't report exit statuses and signals in this situation).

  * A new ‘--force’ option has been added to allow the specification of
    unexistent PIDs.
