* Release 0.3 (2015-01-11)

  * Added a new ‘waitall’ program that lets you specify programs by name,
    rather than by PID (this is similar to what killall(1) does).

  * Switched from the GNU GPL v3 license to the BSD 2-clause license.

  * Minor changes:

    - The ‘--verbose’ option displays a warning if ptrace(2) is not available.


* Release 0.2 (2014-03-09)

  * Added support for waiting multiple PIDs.

  * The new ‘--verbose’ option can be specified both to inspect the exit status
    of the traced processes and to trace the signals sent to them.

  * waitpid can now be used even if ptrace(2) is not available (throught
    ‘--verbose’ won't report exit statuses and signals in this situation).

  * A new ‘--force’ option has been added to allow the specification of
    unexistent PIDs.


* Release 0.1 (2012-09-08)
