do not fail if one of the PID specified does not correspond to a running
process
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sleep\-interval\fR=\fIN\fR
when
.BR ptrace (2)
is not available, check for the existence of the processes every

a signal
.TP

.SH NOTES
When possible, this program will use the
.BR ptrace (2)
system call to wait for programs. With
.BR ptrace (2)
the
.B --sleep-interval
option is ignored, as events are reported immediately. Additionally, if
.B --verbose
is specified, the program will display exit statuses and signals received by
the processes.

If
.BR ptrace (2)
is not available, processes are checked periodically,
.B --sleep-interval
is not ignored and
.B --verbose
does not report detailed information about exit statuses and signals received.
